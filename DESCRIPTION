Description: A biotic index for the implementation of WFD in rocky coastal 
	and sedimentary transitional Mediterranean waters developed by 
	Dr. Sotiris Orfanidis. The concept of the EEI is based on the obvious
	and universal pattern that "anthropogenic disturbance, e.g. 
	pollution-eutrophication, shifts the ecosystem from pristine where 
	late-successional species is dominant to degraded state, where 
	opportunistic species is dominant". Marine benthic macrophytes 
	(seaweeds, angiosperms) were used as bio-indicators of ecosystem 
	shifts, from the pristine state with late-successional species 
	(Ecological State Group I) to the degraded state with opportunistic 
	species (ESG II). In moderately impacted coasts slow growing, 
	shade-adapted calcareous species (ESG IC) and opportunistic macroalgae
	often co-dominate.
