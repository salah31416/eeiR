Description: A biotic index for the environmental quality assessment of 
    marine macroalgae assemblages in coastal and transitional waters. The 
	concept of EEI is based on the obvious and universal pattern that 
	anthropogenic disturbance, eg, eutrophication caused by pollution, 
	changes the pristine ecosystem, where climax species are dominant, 
	to a degraded state, where opportunistic species are dominant".
